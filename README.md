# Backend Development Workspace

Welcome to my **Backend Development Workspace**!  
This repository serves as my central hub for learning, experimenting, and documenting everything I accomplish throughout this backend development course at **Bushnell University**.

---

## 📘 Overview

This workspace is structured to track my progress through multiple units, each focusing on key areas of backend development.  
Inside, you’ll find folders and documentation for topics such as:

- **Version Control with Git and GitHub**  
- **Backend Scripting with Node.js and Python**
- **Advanced Scripting Techniques**
- **Developing and Testing RESTful APIs**

Each folder contains a dedicated `README.md` that will include project notes, reflections, and sample code as the course progresses.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Throughout this course, my main goals are to:

1. Strengthen my understanding of **backend programming languages** and frameworks.  
2. Gain confidence using **Git and GitHub** for professional version control.  
3. Learn to design, test, and document **RESTful APIs** effectively.  
4. Build organized, maintainable codebases that reflect best practices.  
5. Apply backend logic to real-world problems through hands-on projects.

## 🧠 How I Plan to Use This Repository

This repository will grow alongside my learning journey. I will:

- Record weekly reflections in `learning-log.md` to summarize what I’ve learned.  
- Add useful tools and references in `resources.md` for future backend projects.  
- Expand `git-reference.md` with Git commands I use frequently.  
- Update each unit folder with code examples, exercises, and project documentation.  

By the end of the semester, this workspace will act as a **personal knowledge base**—showing my growth from foundational skills to building complete backend systems.
